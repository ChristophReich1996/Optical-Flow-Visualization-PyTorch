# Optical Flow Visualization for PyTorch

This repository is a PyTorch clone of the [OpticalFlow_Visualization](https://github.com/tomrunia/OpticalFlow_Visualization) (flow_vis) repository, originally published under the [MIT license](https://github.com/tomrunia/OpticalFlow_Visualization/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). The optical flow visualization followes the color encoding proposed in the paper "[A database and evaluation methodology for optical flow](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11263-010-0390-2.pdf)" by Baker et al. published at ICCV 2007.
